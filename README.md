Visualizing Titanic survival rates by passenger class, sex, and age.


## Summary
This is a visualization of survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic by class, sex, and age. The dataset includes demographic and passenger information from 891 of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic. The visualization is a series of bar charts that demonstrate the survival rates of male and female passengers in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class. The buttons allow the viewer to see the survival rates for different age groups.

## Design
I wanted to allow the viewer to click between ages to compare the basic bar plot of survival rates by sex and class. In iterating the visualization, I realized it would be helpful to start with a broad view of the survival rates for passengers as a whole by sex and class, so I added the 'All' ages category.
